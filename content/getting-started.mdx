This site uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for dependency management, so make sure it is installed on your system.

Execute [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to bootstrap the example:

```
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/1msirius/Nextfolio my-portfolio
```

Start the development server:

```
pnpm dev
```

The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

Customize your setup by updating your information to ensure proper SEO, feed generation, Open Graph integration, and other settings.

### Config.ts

Update the site metadata and social links in the **app/config.ts** file. These constants are utilized across the site for SEO, feeds, social links, and Open Graph integration.

```
export const metaData = {
  baseUrl: "...", // Update with your site base URL
  title: "...", // Update with your site title
  name: "...", // Update with your name
  ogImage: "...", // Update with your Open Graph image
  description: "...", // Update with your site description
};

export const socialLinks = {
  twitter: "...", // Update with your Twitter URL
  github: "...", // Update with your GitHub URL
  instagram: "...", // Update with your Instagram URL
  linkedin: "...", // Update with your LinkedIn URL
  email: "...", // Update with your email address
};
```

### Sitemap

Adjust the routes to match your portfolioâ€™s navigation in **app/sitemap.ts** file for SEO optimization:

```
// Update routes according to your navbar
let routes = ["", "blog", "projects", "photos"].map((route) => ({
  url: `${BaseUrl}${route}`,
  lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0],
}));
```

### Profile Photo

Update your profile photo by replacing the **public/profile.png** file with your image.

### Favicon

Simply deploy your site on Vercel and enable both features through the Vercel dashboard.
